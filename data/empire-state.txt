It was designed by [[Shreve, Lamb & Harmon]] and completed in 1931. The building has a roof height of {{convert|1250|ft|m}} and stands a total of {{convert|1454|ft|m|1}} tall, including its [[antenna tower|antenna]]. Its name is derived from "[[Empire State]]", the [[List of U.S. state nicknames|nickname]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], which is of unknown origin. {{As of|2019}} the building is the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|5th-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States]] and the [[List of tallest buildings|28th-tallest in the world]]. It is also the [[List of tallest freestanding structures|6th-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas]]. The Empire State Building stood as the world's tallest building for nearly 40 years until the completion of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]'s [[One World Trade Center#Original building|North Tower]] in [[Lower Manhattan]] in late 1970. Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, it was again the tallest building in New York until the new [[One World Trade Center]] was completed in April 2012.

The site of the Empire State Building, located in [[Midtown South]] on the west side of [[Fifth Avenue]] between West [[33rd Street (Manhattan)|33rd]] and [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Streets]], was originally part of an early 18th-century farm, then became the site of the [[Waldorf–Astoria (New York, 1893)|Waldorf–Astoria Hotel]] in 1893.<ref name="ChicagoTribune-Factbox"/> In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite the publicity surrounding the building's construction, its owners failed to make a profit until the early 1950s. However, since its opening, the building's Art Deco architecture and open-air observation deck has made it a popular attraction, with around 4 million tourists from around the world visiting the building's 86th and 102nd floor observatories every year.<ref name=":4"/>

The building stands within a mile of other major Midtown tourist attractions including [[Grand Central Terminal]], [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]], [[Madison Square Garden]], [[Koreatown, Manhattan|Koreatown]], and [[Macy's Herald Square]].

The Empire State Building is an [[United States|American]] [[cultural icon]] and has been featured in more than 250 TV shows and movies since the film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' was released in 1933. A symbol of New York City, the tower has been named as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Modern World]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. The Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior have been designated as a city landmark by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]], and were confirmed as such by the [[New York City Board of Estimate]]. It was also designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986, and was ranked number one on the [[American Institute of Architects]]' List of [[America's Favorite Architecture]] in 2007.

Bethlehem Engineering Corporation originally intended to build a 25-story office building on the Waldorf–Astoria site. The company's president, Floyd De L. Brown, paid $100,000 of the $1&nbsp;million [[down payment]] required to start construction on the tower, with the promise that the difference would be paid later.{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=108}} Brown borrowed $900,000 from a bank, but then [[Default (finance)|defaulted]] on the loan.{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=109}}{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|pp=85–87}}

The Empire State Building design featured one major [[Setback (architecture)|setback]] and several smaller ones that reduce the level dimensions as the height increases, thus making upper 81 floors much smaller than the lower five floors. However, this design allows sunlight to illuminate the interiors of the top floors and, in addition, positions these floors away from the noisy streets below.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=157}}{{sfn|Kayden|Municipal Art Society|2000|pp=8–9}} This design was mandated as per the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]], which was intended to allow sunlight to reach the streets as well.{{Efn|name=zoning|As per the 1916 Zoning Act, the wall of any given tower that faces a street could only rise to a certain height, proportionate to the street's width, at which point the building had to be set back by a given proportion. This system of setbacks would continue until the tower reaches a floor level in which that level's floor area was 25% that of the ground level's area. After that 25% threshold was reached, the building could rise without restriction.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=81}}{{sfn|Kayden|Municipal Art Society|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Willis|1995|p=67}}

The 1916 Zoning Act was amended in 1961 so that buildings erected thereafter could not exceed a [[floor area ratio]] that was calculated for each zoning district.{{sfn|Kayden|Municipal Art Society|2000|pp=11–12}} The maximum ratio for the Empire State Building's district is 15, unless it includes a public plaza.<ref>[https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/districts-tools/c6.page NYC Zoning District C6-4.5]</ref> A [[grandfather clause]] permits preexisting structures to continue under the old rule.

====Lobby====
[[File:Empire State Building in Manhattan, New York, USA (9892744176).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aluminum relief of the building]]

The original main lobby is accessed from Fifth Avenue, on the building's east side, and contains an entrance with one set of [[double door]]s between a pair of [[revolving door]]s. At the top of each doorway is a bronze motif depicting one of three "crafts or industries" used in the building's construction—Electricity, Masonry, and Heating.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=13}} The lobby contains two tiers of marble, a lighter marble on the top, above the storefronts, and a darker marble on the bottom, flush with the storefronts. There is a pattern of zigzagging [[terrazzo]] tiles on the lobby floor, which leads from the entrance on the east to the aluminum relief on the west.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=15}} The chapel-like three-story-high lobby, which runs parallel to 33rd and 34th Streets, contains storefronts on both its northern and southern sides.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|pages=12–13}} These storefronts are framed on each side by tubes of dark "modernistically rounded marble", according to the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]], and above by a vertical band of grooves set into the marble.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=15}} Immediately inside the lobby is an airport-style security checkpoint.{{sfn|Fodor's|2010|p=153}}

The walls on both the northern and southern sides of the lobby house storefronts and escalators to a mezzanine level.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=15}}{{Efn|name=layout-lobby}} At the west end of the lobby is an aluminum relief of the skyscraper as it was originally built (i.e. without the antenna).<ref name=Lepik2008>{{cite book | last=Lepik | first=Andres | title=Skyscrapers | publisher=Prestel | year=2008 | isbn=978-3-7913-3992-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VJJAQAAIAAJ | pages=53–54 | access-date=October 23, 2017}}</ref> The relief, which was intended to provide a welcoming effect,{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=1}} contains an embossing of the building's outline, accompanied by what the Landmarks Preservation Commission describes as "the rays of an aluminum sun shining out behind [the tower] and mingling with aluminum rays emanating from the spire of the Empire State Building". In the background is a state map of New York with the building's location marked by a "medallion" in the very southeast portion of the outline. A compass is located in the bottom right and a plaque to the tower's major developers is on the bottom left.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=14}}

The plaque at the western end of the lobby is located on the eastern interior wall of a one-story tall rectangular-shaped corridor that surrounds the banks of escalators, with a similar design to the lobby.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|pages=12, 15}} The rectangular shaped corridor actually consists of two long hallways on the northern and southern sides of the rectangle,{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=12}} as well as a shorter hallway on the eastern side and another long hallway on the western side.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|pages=12, 15}} At both ends of the northern and southern corridors, there is a bank of four low-rise elevators in between the corridors.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=16}} The western side of the rectangular elevator-bank corridor extends north to the 34th Street entrance and south to the 33rd Street entrance. It borders three large storefronts and leads to escalators that go both to the second floor and to the basement. Going from west to east, there are secondary entrances to 34th and 33rd Streets from both the northern and southern corridors, respectively, at approximately the two-thirds point of each corridor.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=15}}{{Efn|name=layout-lobby|See {{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981}}, PDF page 26, for a diagram of the lobby.}}

Until the 1960s, an art deco mural, inspired by both the sky and the [[Machine Age]], was installed in the lobby ceilings.<ref name=Lepik2008/> Subsequent damage to these murals, designed by artist Leif Neandross, resulted in reproductions being installed. Renovations to the lobby in 2009, such as replacing the clock over the information desk in the Fifth Avenue lobby with an [[anemometer]] and installing two chandeliers intended to be part of the building when it originally opened, revived much of its original grandeur.<ref name=nyt20090923>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/nyregion/23empire.html |title=Overhead, a Lobby Is Restored to Old Glory |work=The New York Times |author=Barron, James |authorlink=James Barron (journalist) |date=September 22, 2009 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306125255/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/nyregion/23empire.html |archivedate=March 6, 2014}}</ref> The north corridor contained eight illuminated panels created in 1963 by Roy Sparkia and Renée Nemorov, in time for the [[1964 World's Fair]], depicting the building as the [[Eighth Wonder of the World]] alongside the traditional seven.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=16}}<ref name=arbus-bio>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CveczaI95Q8C&pg=PA215|title=Diane Arbus: A Biography|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|date=1984|publisher=W.

====Broadcast stations====
[[File:Empirestatebuilding29122005.JPG|thumb|left|Antennae for broadcast stations are located at the top of the Building.]]

Broadcasting began at the Empire State Building on December 22, 1931, when [[NBC]] and [[RCA]] began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the spire, with two separate transmitters for the visual and audio data. They leased the 85th floor and built a laboratory there.<ref name=be196708/> In 1934, RCA was joined by [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] in a cooperative venture to test his FM system from the building's antenna.<ref name=ZarkinZarkin2006/><ref name="Lessing 1956 p. 20">{{cite book | last=Lessing | first=L. | title=Man of High Fidelity: Edwin Howard Armstrong: A Biography | publisher=Lippincott | year=1956 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYAeAAAAIAAJ | access-date=October 23, 2017 | page=20}}</ref> This setup, which entailed the installation of the world's first [[Frequency modulation|FM transmitter]],<ref name="Lessing 1956 p. 20"/> continued only until October of the next year due to disputes between RCA and Armstrong.<ref name=be196708/><ref name=ZarkinZarkin2006>{{cite book | last=Zarkin | first=K. | last2=Zarkin | first2=M.J. | title=The Federal Communications Commission: Front Line in the Culture and Regulation Wars | publisher=Greenwood Press | series=Understanding our government | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-313-33416-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZ33mq1mLmAC&pg=PA109 | access-date=October 23, 2017 | pages=109–110}}</ref> Specifically, NBC wanted to install more TV equipment in the room where Armstrong's transmitter was located.<ref name="Lessing 1956 p. 20"/>

After some time, the 85th floor became home to RCA's New York television operations initially as experimental station W2XBS channel 1 then, from 1941, as commercial station WNBT channel 1 (now [[WNBC-TV]] channel 4).

The placement of the stations in the Empire State Building became a major issue with the construction of the World Trade Center Twin Towers in the late 1960s, and early 1970s. The greater height of the Twin Towers would reflect radio waves broadcast from the Empire State Building, eventually resulting in some broadcasters relocating to the newer towers instead of suing the developer, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]].{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=356}} Even though the nine stations who were broadcasting from the Empire State Building were leasing their broadcast space until 1984, most of these stations moved to the World Trade Center as soon as it was completed in 1971. The broadcasters obtained a court order stipulating that the Port Authority had to build a mast and transmission equipment in the [[One World Trade Center#Original building|North Tower]], as well as pay the broadcasters' leases in the Empire State Building until 1984.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|pp=356–357}} Only a few broadcasters renewed their leases in the Empire State Building.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=357}}

The [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 destroyed the World Trade Center and the broadcast centers atop it, leaving most of the city's stations without a station for ten days until a temporary tower was built in [[Alpine, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Guerrero et al.|2002|p=36}} By October 2001, nearly all of the city's commercial broadcast stations (both television and FM radio) were again transmitting from the top of the Empire State Building. In a report that [[United States Congress|Congress]] commissioned about the transition from [[analog television]] to [[digital television]], it was stated that the placement of broadcast stations in the Empire State Building was considered "problematic" due to interference from other nearby towers. In comparison, the Congressional report stated that the former Twin Towers had very few buildings of comparable height nearby thus signals suffered little interference.{{sfn|Guerrero et al.|2002|p=37}} In 2003, a few FM stations were relocated to the nearby [[Condé Nast Building]] to reduce the number of broadcast stations using the Empire State Building.<ref>{{cite book | last=Cianci | first=P.J. | title=High Definition Television: The Creation, Development and Implementation of HDTV Technology | publisher=McFarland, Incorporated, Publishers | year=2013 | isbn=978-0-7864-8797-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mbsfr38GTgC&pg=PA254 | access-date=October 23, 2017 | page=254}}</ref> Eleven [[Television broadcasting|television]] stations and twenty-two [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations had signed 15-year leases in the building by May 2003. It was expected that a taller broadcast tower in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], or [[Governors Island]], would be built in the meantime with the Empire State Building being used as a "backup" since signal transmissions from the building were generally of poorer quality.<ref>{{cite web | last=Bagli | first=Charles V. | title=Broadcasters Put Antennas in Midtown | website=The New York Times | date=May 12, 2003 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/12/nyregion/broadcasters-put-antennas-in-midtown.html | access-date=October 26, 2017}}</ref>

With the completion of [[1 World Trade Center]], some TV Stations began moving their transmitting facilities to 1 World Trade Center, while others, including [[WABC-TV]] remained at the Empire State Building, with no plans to consider a move to the new tower.

{{As of|2018}}, the Empire State Building is home to the following stations:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiomap.us/us-ny/new-york|title=Radio stations in New York, NY|publisher=World Radio Map|accessdate=October 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027025152/http://www.radiomap.us/us-ny/new-york|archive-date=October 27, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

=== Iconic status===
[[File:Souvenirempirestate.JPG|thumb|upright|Souvenir of the building]]

As an icon of the United States, it is also very popular among Americans.
