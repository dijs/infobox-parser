"'''All Around the World'''" is a song by English singer [[Lisa Stansfield]] from her debut studio [[album]] ''[[Affection (Lisa Stansfield album)|Affection]]'' (1989). It was released as the album's second single on 16 October 1989 by [[Arista Records]]. It was written by Stansfield, Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, and produced by Devaney and Morris. The song received favorable reviews from music critics. Songwriters, Stansfield, Devaney and Morris, received the 1989 [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Song Musically and Lyrically.<ref>Lister, David, "Pop ballads bite back in lyrical fashion", ''[[The Independent]]'', 28 May 1994</ref> "All Around the World" was also nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[33rd Annual Grammy Awards]]. Additionally, Stansfield was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]]. The song became the first of two UK number-one singles for Stansfield (the second being an appearance on [[George Michael]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Five Live (George Michael and Queen EP)|Five Live]]" EP) and the first of eight top-ten hits she would achieve in that country.

In 2003, "All Around the World" was included on ''[[Biography: The Greatest Hits]]''. In 2014, the remixes of "All Around the World" were included on the deluxe 2CD + DVD re-releases of ''Affection'', ''[[Face Up (album)|Face Up]]'' and on the ''[[People Hold On ... The Remix Anthology]]'' compilation (also on ''[[The Collection 1989–2003]]'').

==Background and release==
{{Quote box|width=25%|align=left|quote="All Around the World was top of most. Over the years, a lot of people have told me the song helped them through a difficult period. That's beautiful, to know you've helped someone in that way. The song literally took us around the world, four times. I suppose you have to be careful what you sing, because you might have to do it."|source=—[[Lisa Stansfield]] talking about the song.<ref name="Simpson">{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Dave|title=Lisa Stansfield: how we made All Around the World|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/14/lisa-stansfield-how-we-made-all-around-the-world|work=The Guardian|date=14 October 2019|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref>
}} Stansfield co-wrote the lyrics of "All Around the World" with her former bandmates Ian Devaney and Andy Morris from [[Blue Zone (band)|Blue Zone]]. In a 2019 interview, Stansfield recalled the process when the song was made: {{cquote|I came into the studio, and Ian was messing around at the piano. He had a melody, and I just started singing: "Been around the world and I, I, I…" Everyone laughed but Ian said, "Wait, it's really good, that." It just came into my head – it was nonsense, but had a really good feel to it. "I, I, I" became the main hook. We'd no idea how massive it would become.}}
The song came down quickly and on low budget. The vocal part was made in only two takes and real strings were put on afterwards. The song is largely influenced by American singer-songwriter [[Barry White]]. As a tribute to him, they made a spoken intro on "All Around the World" like the one on the album version of White's "Let the Music Play", only shorter.<ref name="Simpson">{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Dave|title=Lisa Stansfield: how we made All Around the World|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/14/lisa-stansfield-how-we-made-all-around-the-world|work=The Guardian|date=14 October 2019|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref>

The song was released as the second European single on 16 October 1989. It was remixed by Yvonne Turner, [[Eddie Gordon]], Paul Witts and [[Steve Anderson (musician)|Steve Anderson]]. In North America, "All Around the World" was released as the first single on 15 January 1990 and included remixes created by [[The 45 King]] and Richard Sweret. In Japan, the single was released on 7 February 1990. Stansfield went on to become the first white British woman to reach number-one on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart, the American black music chart. A music video was made to accompany the song, directed by [[Philip Richardson]].

==Critical reception==
The song received favorable reviews from many music critics. Matthew Hocter from Albumism called it "sultry and heartbreakingly beautiful".<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Hocter |title= Lisa Stansfield's Debut Album 'Affection' Turns 30: Anniversary Retrospective |publisher= Albumism |date= 17 November 2019 |access-date= 3 May 2020 |url= https://www.albumism.com/features/lisa-stansfield-debut-album-affection-turns-30-anniversary-retrospective}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] editor Alex Henderson described it as a "melancholy, [[Barry White]]-influenced single" and noted further that "it was obvious that not since [[Teena Marie]] had a white female singer performed R&B so convincingly."<ref>{{cite web|author=Alex Henderson|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/affection-mw0000654618|title=Allmusic: Affection Review|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2 November 2011}}</ref> Bill Coleman from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' said it "sports that all-too-familiar [[Soul II Soul]]-ish feel but it's the lyric and Stansfield's emotive vocal which take it to the next level."<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Bill |last= Coleman |title= Dance Trax: Stansfield's 'World' Hit Finally Breaks in U.S. |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 20 January 1990 |page= 31 |access-date= 14 October 2020 |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1990/BB-1990-01-20.pdf}}</ref> Ernest Hardy from ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' stated that "it’s her earthy vocals swarthed in whirling strings and placed against a soft beat that sets toes tapping, shoulders swaying and heads bopping."

The video opens with a close-up of Stansfield in black-and-white speaking the intro. As the song begins, the camera circle around Stansfield, now in colours. The backdrop is a world map. Her hair is very short, she wears red lipstick and her famous kiss curls. Next she sits outdoors in the rain, performing on the stairs in front of a house. Other scenes shows Stansfield singing, while she rotates in the middle of a ring of men standing next to each other as the camera follows her round. Towards the end, she stands in the rain and sings as the raindrops are falling on her face.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuuatjHGnY|title=Lisa Stansfield - All Around the World (Official Video)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=9 October 2012|access-date=5 March 2020}}</ref>
