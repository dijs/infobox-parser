The '''Chrysler Building''' is an [[Art Deco]]–style [[Early skyscrapers|skyscraper]] located in the [[Turtle Bay, Manhattan|Turtle Bay]] neighborhood on the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] of [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]], at the intersection of [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington Avenue]]. At {{convert|318.9|m|ft|0|order=flip|sp=us}}, the structure was the [[List of tallest buildings and structures#History|world's tallest building]] for 11 months before it was surpassed by the [[Empire State Building]] in 1931.<ref name=skyscraperCenter/><ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://ctbuh.org/AboutCTBUH/History/MeasuringTall/tabid/1320/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=The History of Measuring Tall Buildings |website=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=May 1, 2012}}</ref> It is the tallest brick building in the world with a steel framework. {{As of|2018}}, the Chrysler is the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|eighth-tallest building in the city]], tied with [[The New York Times Building]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.amny.com/real-estate/tallest-buildings-in-nyc-1.9216740|title=12 tallest skyscrapers in New York City|work=am New York|access-date=October 17, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Originally a project of real estate developer and former New York State Senator [[William H. Reynolds (senator)|William H. Reynolds]], the building was constructed by [[Walter Chrysler]], the head of the [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]], and served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with [[40 Wall Street]] and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. Although the Chrysler Building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it, as Walter Chrysler decided to pay for it himself, so that his children could inherit it.

When the Chrysler Building opened, there were mixed reviews of the building's design, ranging from its being inane and unoriginal to that it was modernist and iconic. Perceptions of the building have slowly evolved into its now being seen as a paragon of the Art Deco architectural style; and in 2007, it was ranked ninth on the ''[[List of America's Favorite Architecture according to the AIA|List of America's Favorite Architecture]]'' by the [[American Institute of Architects]].

In 1921, Reynolds rented a large plot of land at the corner of [[Lexington Avenue]] and 42nd Street with the intention of building a tall building on the site.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=1}}<ref name="jayebee.com" /> In 1927, after several years of delays, Reynolds hired the architect&nbsp;[[William Van Alen]] to build a forty-story building there.<ref name="NYTimes-Never-Again-Scaled-2005">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/garden/for-the-architect-a-height-never-again-to-be-scaled.html|title=For the Architect, a Height Never Again to Be Scaled|last=Bascomb|first=Neal|date=May 26, 2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 1, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Van Alen was respected in his field for his work on the Albemarle Building at Broadway and 24th Street, designing it in collaboration with his partner&nbsp;[[H.

By February 2, 1928, the proposed building's height had been increased to 54 stories, which would have made it the tallest building in Midtown.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1928/02/02/95549248.pdf|title=54-Story Skyscraper, Tallest in Midtown, Planned at Lexington Avenue and 42d Street|last=|first=|date=February 2, 1928|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 8, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The proposal was changed again two weeks later, with official plans for a 63-story building.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1928/02/16/91475150.pdf|title=SKYSCRAPER PLANS FILED.; 63-Story Offices to Rise on Lexington Av.

In April 1928, Reynolds signed a 67-year lease for the plot and finalized the details of his ambitious project.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=146}} Van Alen's original design for the skyscraper called for a base whose first-floor showroom windows would be triple-height, and above would be 12 stories with glass-wrapped corners, to create the impression that the tower was floating in mid-air.<ref name="jayebee.com" /><ref name="NYEP-Reynolds-Tallest-1928">{{cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252011%2FNew%2520York%2520Evening%2520Post%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Evening%2520Post%25201928%2520Grayscale%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Evening%2520Post%25201928%2520Grayscale%2520-%25205602.pdf|title=Reynolds Building Will Be Tallest Structure in World|work=New York Evening Post|page=12|date=July 28, 1929|accessdate=November 3, 2017|via=[[Fultonhistory.com]]}}</ref> Reynolds's main contribution to the building's design was his insistence that it have a metallic crown, despite Van Alen's initial opposition;{{sfn|Nash|McGrath|1999|p=63}} the metal-and-crystal crown would have looked like "a jeweled sphere" at night.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=189}} Originally, the skyscraper would have risen {{convert|808|ft|m|0|sp=us}}, with 67 floors.<ref name="emporis" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1928/07/29/121606495.pdf|title=GRAND CENTRAL ZONE TO HAVE TALLEST BUILDING IN WORLD|last=|first=|date=July 29, 1928|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 2, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name=NYEP-Reynolds-Tallest-1928/> These plans were approved in June 1928.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1928/06/06/91523940.pdf|title=APPROVE NEW SKYSCRAPER|last=|first=|date=June 6, 1928|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 2, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Van Alen's drawings were unveiled in the following August and published in a magazine run by the&nbsp;[[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA).{{sfn|Kingston|2017|pp=145}}

Eventually, this design would prove too advanced and expensive for Reynolds.<ref name="allpar" /> He instead devised an alternate design for the Reynolds Building, which was published in August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] dome that a critic compared to Governor [[Al Smith]]'s bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.<ref name="jayebee.com" />

=== Construction and finalization of plans ===
With the design complete, groundbreaking for the Reynolds Building took place on September 19, 1928,<ref name="allpar" /> but Reynolds did not have the means to carry on construction.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=161}}<ref name="in-arch" /> Reynolds sold the plot, lease, plans, and architect's services to Walter Chrysler for $2 million on October 15, 1928.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=161}}<ref name="NYTimes-Chrysler-Plans-1928" /> That same day, the Goodwin Construction Company began demolition of what had been built.{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=109}}<ref name="NYTimes-Chrysler-Plans-1928"/> A contract was awarded on October 28,<ref>{{Cite news | title=Prizes for Building Workers In Novel Poster Safety Campaign |last=|first=|date=October 28, 1928|work=The New York Times|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and demolition was completed on November 9.{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=109}} Chrysler's initial plans for the building were similar to Reynolds's, but with the 808-foot building having 68 floors instead of 67.

The same year that the Chrysler Building's construction started, banker [[George L. Ohrstrom]] proposed the construction of a 47-story office building at [[40 Wall Street]] downtown. Shortly thereafter Ohrstrom modified his project to have 60 floors, but it was still below Woolworth and the 808-foot Chrysler Building project as announced in 1928.<ref name="Gray 1992"/> H. Craig Severance, Van Alen's former partner and the architect of 40 Wall Street, increased 40 Wall's height to {{convert|840|ft|m}} with 62 floors in April of that year. It would thus exceed the Woolworth's height by {{convert|48|ft|m}} and the Chrysler's by {{convert|32|ft|m}}.<ref name="Gray 1992"/> 40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building started competing for the distinction of "[[List of tallest buildings in the world|world's tallest building]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/the-trump-building-new-york-city-ny-usa|title=Emporis Data "...a celebrated three-way race to become the tallest building in the world."|author=Emporis GmbH|publisher=Emporis.com|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscraper.org/TALLEST_TOWERS/t_manco.htm|title=The Manhattan Company – Skyscraper.org; "...'race' to erect the tallest tower in the world."|publisher=Skyscraper.org|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref> The [[Empire State Building]], on 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, entered the competition in 1929. The "Race into the Sky", as popular media called it at the time, was representative of the country's optimism in the 1920s, which helped fuel the building boom in major cities.{{sfn|Rasenberger|2009|pp=388–389}} The 40 Wall Street tower was revised from {{convert|840|ft|m}} to 925 feet in April 1929, which would make it the world's tallest.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=130}} Severance increased the height of his project and then publicly claimed the title of the world's tallest building.<ref>Emporis Data – See source no.4 line 4; "Briefly held the world's tallest title until it was eclipsed by the spire of Chrysler Building."</ref> Construction of 40 Wall Street began in May 1929 at a frantic pace, and it was completed twelve months later.<ref name="Gray 1992"/>

In response, Van Alen obtained permission for a {{convert|125|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} spire{{sfn|Stravitz|2002|p=161}}{{sfn|Binder|2006|p=102}} and had it secretly constructed inside the frame of his building.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=130}} The spire was delivered to the site in four different sections.{{sfn|Stravitz|2002|p=161}} On October 23, 1929, one week after surpassing the Woolworth Building's height and one day before the catastrophic [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] started, the spire was assembled. According to one account, "the bottom section of the spire was hoisted to the top of the building's dome and lowered into the 66th floor of the building."<ref name="Gray 1992"/> Then, within 90 minutes the rest of the spire's pieces were raised and riveted in sequence,{{sfn|Stravitz|2002|p=xiii, 161}} helping raise the tower's height to 1,046 feet.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=426}}{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=110}} Van Alen, who witnessed the process from the street along with its engineers and Walter Chrysler,{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=426}} compared the experience to watching a butterfly leaving its cocoon.{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=110}}

In "The Structure and Metal Work of the Chrysler Building", an article published in the October 1930 edition of ''[[Architectural Forum]]'', Van Alen explained the design and construction of the crown and needle:{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=425}}<ref name="Skyscraper_Museum"/>

{{quote|A high spire structure with a needle-like termination was designed to surmount the dome. This is 185 feet high and 8 feet square at its base. It was made up of four corner angles, with light angle strut and diagonal members, all told weighing 27 tons. It was manifestly impossible to assemble this structure and hoist it as a unit from the ground, and equally impossible to hoist it in sections and place them as such in their final positions. Besides, it would be more spectacular, for publicity value, to have this cloud-piercing needle appear unexpectedly.}}

The steel tip brought the Chrysler Building to a height of {{convert|1046|ft|m}}, greatly exceeding 40 Wall Street's height.{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|p=14}} However, contemporary news media did not write of the spire's erection, nor were there any press releases celebrating the spire's erection. Even the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', which had virtually continuous coverage of the tower's construction, did not report on the spire's installation until days after the spire had been raised.{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=258}}

Chrysler realized that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having ordered Van Alen to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] dome to the narrow steel spire.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=130}} However, the Empire State's developer [[John J. Raskob]] reviewed the plans and realized that he could add five more floors and a spire of his own to his 80-story building,{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=131}} and subsequently acquired the nearby plots needed to support that building's height extension.{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=230}}<ref>{{cite news | title=ENLARGES SITE FOR 1,000-FOOT BUILDING | work=The New York Times | date=November 19, 1929 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/11/19/107107719.pdf | access-date=October 24, 2017}}</ref> Two days later, the Empire State Building's co-developer, former Governor Al Smith, announced the updated plans for that skyscraper, with an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of {{convert|1050|ft|m}}, higher than the Chrysler's 71st-floor observation deck.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=131}}

== Architecture ==
[[File:Chrysler building- top.jpg|thumb|The building's distinctive Art Deco crown and spire]]

The Chrysler Building is considered a leading example of [[Art Deco]] architecture.<ref>{{cite web | title=Art Deco Design Style: Origins, History, Characteristics | website=Visual Arts Encyclopedia | url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/art-deco.htm | access-date=November 4, 2017}}</ref>{{sfn|Binder|2006|p=62}} It is constructed of a steel frame in-filled with masonry, with areas of decorative metal cladding.

The Chrysler Building uses bright "Nirosta"{{sfn|Cobb|2010|pp=105&ndash;106}} [[stainless steel]] extensively in its design, an [[austenitic]] alloy developed in Germany by [[Krupp]]{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=173}}{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} (a German [[acronym]] for '''''ni'''cht'''ro'''stender '''Sta'''hl'', meaning "non-rusting steel").<ref name="jayebee.com"/>{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=106}} It was the first use of this "18-8 stainless steel" in an American project,{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=260}} composed of 18% [[chromium]] and 8% [[nickel]].{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=106}} Nirosta was used in the exterior ornaments, the window frames, the crown, and the needle.{{sfn|Cobb|2010|pp=106–108}} The steel was an integral part of Van Alen's design, as E.E. Thum explains: "The use of permanently bright metal was of greatest aid in the carrying of rising lines and the diminishing circular forms in the roof treatment, so as to accentuate the gradual upward swing until it literally dissolves into the sky...."{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=118}}<ref>{{cite book | last=Thum | first=E.E. | title=The book of stainless steels: corrosion resisting and heat resisting alloys | publisher=American Society for Metals | year=1935 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_BhvgAACAAJ | access-date=November 5, 2017 | page=657}}</ref> Stainless steel producers used the Chrysler Building to evaluate the durability of the product in architecture. In 1929, the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing Materials]] created an inspection committee to study its performance, which regarded the Chrysler Building as the best location to do so; a subcommittee examined the building's panels every five years until 1960, when the inspections were canceled because the panels had shown minimal deterioration.{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=119}}

The Chrysler Building's height and legally mandated setbacks influenced Van Alen in his design.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} The walls of the lowermost sixteen floors rise directly from the sidewalk property lines, except for a recess on one side that gives the building a "U"-shaped floor plan above the fourth floor. There are setbacks on floors 16, 18, 23, 28, and 31, making the building compliant with the Zoning Law of 1916. This gives the building the appearance of a [[ziggurat]] on one side and a U-shaped [[palazzo]] on the other.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}} Above the 31st floor, there are no more setbacks until the 60th floor, above which the structure is funneled into a [[Maltese cross]] shape{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=96}} that "blends the square shaft to the [[finial]]", according to author and photographer [[Cervin Robinson]].{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}}

The floor plans of the first sixteen floors were made as large as possible to optimize the amount of rental space nearest ground level, which was seen as most desirable. The U-shaped cut above the fourth floor served as a shaft for air flow and illumination. The area between floors 28 and 31 added "visual interest to the middle of the building, preventing it from being dominated by the heavy detail of the lower floors and the eye-catching design of the finial. They provide a base to the column of the tower, effecting a transition between the blocky lower stories and the lofty shaft."{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}}

==== Designs between setbacks ====
The ground floor exterior is covered in polished [[black granite]] from Shastone, while the three floors above it are done in [[white marble]] from Georgia. There are two main entrances, on Lexington Avenue and on 42nd Street, each three floors high with Shastone granite surrounding each [[proscenium]]-shaped entryway. At some distance into each main entryway, there are revolving doors located "beneath intricately patterned metal and glass screens", designed so as to embody the Art Deco tenet of amplifying the entrance's visual impact. A smaller side entrance on 43rd Street is only one story high.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}}{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=175}} There are storefronts consisting of large Nirosta-steel-framed windows at ground level, with office windows on the second through fourth floors.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}}

The west and east elevations of the building contain the air shafts above the fourth floor, while the north and south sides contain the receding setbacks.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} Below the 16th floor, the facade is clad with white brick interrupted by white-marble bands in a manner similar to a [[basket weaving]].{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=161}} The windows, arranged in grids, do not have [[window sill]]s, the frames being flush with the facade.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} Between the 16th and 24th floors, the exterior exhibits vertical white brick columns that are separated by windows on each floor. This visual effect is made possible by the presence of aluminum [[spandrel]]s between the columns of windows on each floor. There are abstract reliefs on the 20th through 22nd-floor spandrels, while the 24th floor contains {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} decorative pineapples.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}}

Above the third setback, consisting of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. Above the fourth setback, between the 27th and 31st floors, the shaft starts to appear.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions help counter a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}}{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=96}} The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders,{{sfn|Nash|McGrath|1999|p=63}} which symbolizes both the Chrysler Corporation and serves as a visual signature of the building's Art Deco design.<ref name="jayebee.com"/><ref name="emporis" /> The bonnet embellishments take the shape of [[Mercury (god)|Mercury's]] [[Petasos|winged helmet]] and resemble hood ornaments installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=96}}

The shaft of the tower was designed to emphasize both the horizontal and vertical: each of the tower's four sides contains three columns of windows, each framed by bricks and an unbroken marble pillar that rises along the entirety of each side. The spandrels separating the windows contain "alternating vertical stripes in gray and white brick", while each corner contains horizontal rows of black brick.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=4}}

=== Interior ===
The interior of the building contains several innovative elements. The partitions between the offices are soundproofed and divided into interchangeable sections, so that the layout of any could be changed quickly and comfortably. Pipes under the floors carry both telephone and electricity cables.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=4}}

The triangular-shaped lobby{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=259}}{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=175}} is regarded as a paragon of the Art Deco style, with clear influences of [[German Expressionism]].{{sfn|Nash|McGrath|1999|p=63}} Chrysler wanted the design to impress other architects and automobile magnates, so he imported various materials without giving consideration to the extra costs incurred.<ref name="Trachtenberg Hyman 2002"/> He covered the walls with huge slabs of African red [[granite]].<ref name="Trachtenberg Hyman 2002">{{cite book | last=Trachtenberg | first=M. | last2=Hyman | first2=I. | title=Architecture, from Prehistory to Postmodernity | publisher=Harry N.

The lobby has dim lighting that gives it a somewhat subdued quality, although the appliqués of the lamps are striking and iconic. Both combine to create an intimate atmosphere and act to highlight the place.<ref name="Trachtenberg Hyman 2002"/> Vertical bars of fluorescent light are covered with Belgian blue marble and Mexican amber onyx, which soften and diffuse the light, to both illuminate and blend with the red marble walls.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=430}} The lobby also contains four elevator banks, each with a different design.{{sfn|Binder|2006|p=62}}{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=259}}

The ceiling contains a {{convert|110|by|67|ft|m|adj=on}} mural named "Transport and Human Endeavor", commissioned by [[Edward Trumbull]] in 1930. The mural's theme is "energy and man's application of it to the solution of his problems", and it pays homage to the [[Aviation between the World Wars|Golden Age of Aviation]] and the [[Machine Age]].<ref name="Dunlap 1999">{{cite web| last=Dunlap | first=David W. | title=POSTINGS: 110- by 76-Foot Work on Ceiling Was Installed in 1930; Chrysler Building Mural Awakens | website=The New York Times | date=March 21, 1999 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/21/realestate/postings-110-76-foot-work-ceiling-was-installed-1930-chrysler-building-mural.html | access-date=November 5, 2017}}</ref>{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=259}} The mural is painted in the shape of a "Y" with ocher and golden tones. The central image of the mural is a "muscled giant whose brain directs his boundless energy to the attainment of the triumphs of this mechanical era", according to a 1930 pamphlet that advertised the building. The mural's Art Deco style is manifested in characteristic triangles, sharp angles, slightly curved lines, chrome ornaments, and numerous patterns.<ref name="Dunlap 1999"/> The mural depicts several silver planes, including the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'', as well as furnaces of incandescent steel and the building itself.{{sfn|Miller|2015|pp=259–260}}{{sfn|Nash|McGrath|1999|p=63}} There is a wall panel dedicated to the work of clinchers, surveyors, masons, carpenters, plasterers, and builders.

There are 32 elevators in the skyscraper, clustered into groups of six or eight.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} At the time of opening, 28 of these elevators were for passenger use.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=171}} Each bank serves different floors within the building, with several "express" elevators going from the lobby to a few landings in between, while "local" elevators connect the landings with the floors above these intermediate landings.<ref>{{cite web | title=ELEVATOR PROBLEMS IN HIGH BUILDINGS | work=The New York Times | date=May 11, 1930 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/05/11/97799980.pdf | access-date=November 5, 2017}}</ref> As per Walter Chrysler's wishes, the elevators were designed to run at a rate of {{convert|900|ft/min|m/min}},<ref name=":0" /> despite the {{convert|700|ft/min|m/min|adj=on}} speed restriction enforced in all city elevators at the time.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=4}} This restriction was loosened soon after the Empire State Building opened in 1931, as that building had also been equipped with high-speed elevators.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=183}} The Chrysler Building also had three of the longest elevator shafts in the world at the time of completion.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=4}}

Over the course of a year, Van Alen painstakingly designed these elevators with the assistance of L.T.M. Ralston, who was in charge of developing the elevator cabs' mechanical parts.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} The cabs were manufactured by the [[Otis Elevator Company]],<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.otis.com/_layouts/ProjectItemPopup.aspx?productItemNo=8&siteURL=http://www.otis.com/site/cn-eng/Pages/GlobalProjectGallery.aspx?menuID=6|title = GLOBAL PROJECT GALLERY: Chrysler Building|access-date = February 15, 2016|publisher = [[Otis Elevator Company]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.hevac-heritage.org/biographies/surnames_M-R/otis/O2-OTIS.pdf|title = Early 20thCentury New York, 1900-1931|access-date = February 15, 2016|publisher = CIBSE Heritage Group|last = Roberts|first = Euring Brian}}</ref> while the doors were made by the Tyler Company. The dimensions of each elevator were {{convert|5.5|ft|m}} deep by {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} The doors are made of metal and covered with eight types of exotic woods.<ref name="in-arch"/> When the doors are closed, they resemble "tall fans set off by metallic palm fronds rising through a series of silver parabolas, whose edges were set off by curved lilies" from the outside, as noted by Curcio. However, when a set of doors is open, the cab behind the doors resembles "an exquisite Art Deco room".{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} These elements were influenced by Egyptian designs, which significantly impacted the Art Deco style.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=171}} According to Vincent Curcio, "these elevator interiors were perhaps the single most beautiful and, next to the dome, the most important feature of the entire building."{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}}

Even though the woods in the elevator cabs were arranged in four basic patterns, each cab had a unique combination of woods. One writer stated that "if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [the elevators] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences on the design of the entire building."{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}}  The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=171}} Curcio wrote that these elevators "are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and it is fair to say that no one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them".{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} Curcio compared the elevators to the curtains of a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings.{{sfn|Nash|McGrath|1999|p=63}} Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary [[marquetry]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Knowles | first=Eric | title=Art Deco | publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing | series=Shire Collections | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-7478-1521-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OhjDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA115 | access-date=November 5, 2017 | page=115}}</ref>

==== Crown ====
[[File:Chrysler Building detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of the Art Deco ornamentation at the crown]]

The Chrysler Building is renowned for, and recognized by, its terraced crown, which is an extension of the main tower.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}} Composed of seven radiating terraced arches, Van Alen's design of the crown is a cruciform [[groin vault]] of seven concentric members with transitioning setbacks, mounted one behind another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecityreview.com/chryslerb.html |title=The City Review.com – Chrysler Building by AIA Carter B. Horsley |publisher=Thecityreview.com |accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref> The entire crown is clad with Nirosta steel, ribbed and riveted in a radiating [[sunburst]] pattern with many triangular vaulted windows, transitioning into smaller segments of the seven narrow setbacks of the terraced crown.<ref name="jayebee.com"/>{{sfn|Cobb|2010|pp=105&ndash;108}} Due to the curved shape of the dome, the Nirosta sheets had to be measured on site, so most of the work was carried out in workshops on the building's 67th and 75th floors.<ref name="Skyscraper_Museum"/>

According to Robinson, "Its 'dormers', each smaller and higher than the previous one, continue the wedding-cake layering of the building itself. This concept is carried forward from the 61st floor, whose eagle gargoyles echo the treatment of the 31st, to the spire, which extends the concept of 'higher and narrower' forward to infinite height and infinitesimal width. This unique treatment emphasizes the building's height, giving it an other worldly atmosphere reminiscent of the fantastic architecture of Coney Island or the Far East."{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}}

Chrysler Center is the name of the building complex consisting of the Chrysler Building, Chrysler Building East, and the commercial pavilion located between the two, called Chrysler Trylons. In 1998, Tishman Speyer acquired the entire complex<ref name=NYTimes-New-Owner-1997/> and proceeded to renovate it completely over the next two years.<ref name="Dunlap 2001"/>

The Chrysler Building annex at 666 Third Avenue, also known as the Kent Building at the time, was renovated and renamed Chrysler Building East.<ref name="Dunlap 2001"/> This [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] building, built in 1952,<ref name=RealDeal-666Third/> is {{convert|432|ft|m}} high and has 32 floors.<ref>{{ctbuh|115170|name=Kent Building}}</ref><ref name="emporis-calyon">{{emporis|114867|name=Calyon Building}}</ref> The mechanical systems were modernized and the interior was modified.

Finally, a new building, which was also designed by Philip Johnson, was built between the original skyscraper and the annex.<ref>{{cite web | last=Dunlap | first=David W. | title=Chrome Spire By Chrysler To Meet Crystal By Johnson | website=The New York Times | date=June 28, 1998 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/28/nyregion/chrome-spire-by-chrysler-to-meet-crystal-by-johnson.html | access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref> This became the Chrysler Trylons, a commercial pavilion three stories high with a retail area of {{convert|22,000|ft2|m2}}. Its design, consisting of three triangular glass pyramids that intersect each other, was inspired by the triangular windows of the Chrysler Building's crown. The building's design was so complex that a replica was built at [[Rimouski]], [[Quebec]]. Johnson designed Chrysler Trylons as "a monument for 42nd Street [...] to give you the top of the Chrysler Building at street level."<ref name="Dunlap 2001">{{cite web| last=Dunlap | first=David W. | title=Commercial Real Estate; Philip Johnson's Latest Creation Is Now Stopping Traffic | website=The New York Times | date=May 9, 2001 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/nyregion/commercial-real-estate-philip-johnson-s-latest-creation-is-now-stopping-traffic.html | access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref>

After these modifications, the total leasable area of the complex was {{convert|2,062,772|ft2|m2}}.<ref name=ts-center/> The total cost of this project was about one hundred million dollars.<ref name="Dunlap 2001"/> This renovation has won several awards and commendations, including an [[Energy Star]] rating from the [[Environmental Protection Agency]];<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/science/earth/new-york-citys-effort-to-track-energy-efficiency-yields-some-surprises.html|title=New York City’s Effort to Track Energy Efficiency Yields Some Surprises|last=Navarro|first=Mireya|date=December 24, 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 6, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> a LEED Gold designation;<ref name="realdeal20121029">{{Cite news|url=https://therealdeal.com/2012/10/29/chrysler-building-gets-a-green-makeover/|title=Chrysler Building gets a green makeover|date=October 29, 2012|work=The Real Deal New York|access-date=November 6, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> and the Skyscraper Museum Outstanding Renovation Award of 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscraper.org/PROGRAMS/EVENTS_ARCHIVE/MAKING_NEW_YORK_HISTORY_2001/mnyh01.htm|title=THE 2001 MAKING NEW YORK HISTORY AWARDS|date=November 15, 2001|website=The Skyscraper Museum|access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref>
