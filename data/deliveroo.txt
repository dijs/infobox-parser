===History and basic operations===
Deliveroo, headquartered in London, was founded in 2013 by [[Will Shu]] and [[Greg Orlowski]].<ref name=Deliverooleaflet>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2016-6/deliveroo_13855.pdf|title=Introduction to Deliveroo|date=4 February 2016|access-date=12 November 2016|website=European Commission|author=Deliveroo}}</ref> The company makes revenue by charging restaurants a commission fee, as well as by charging customers a per-order fee.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2016/02/17/deliveroo-army-5000-drivers-3-years/|title=Here's How Deliveroo Built An Army Of 5,000 Drivers In Just 3 Years|first=Parmy|last=Olson|work=Forbes|date=17 February 2016|access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref> It operates in two hundred cities<ref name=Sassard2017>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/deliveroo-fundraising/uks-deliveroo-raises-nearly-500-mln-ahead-of-200th-city-launch-idUSL8N1NN4JE|title=UK's Deliveroo raises nearly $500 mln ahead of 200th city launch |first=Sophie|last=Sassard |date=17 November 2017 |publisher=Reuters|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> in the [[UK]], and in The [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Ireland]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Australia]], [[Singapore]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Hong Kong]].

In November 2017, Deliveroo introduced Deliveroo Plus, a subscription service which gives customers in the UK unlimited free delivery<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/deliveroos-subscription-service-is-now-available-across-the-uk-2017-11?r=US&IR=T|title=Deliveroo's £7.99 a month subscription service is now available across the UK|first=Sam|last=Shead|date=8 November 2017|publisher=BusinessInsider|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref>

Deliveroo works with some of the biggest chain restaurants across the UK, with the majority being available exclusively on the Deliveroo app along with thousands of independent restaurants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deliveroo.co.uk/sitemap/|title=Deliveroo Sitemap|publisher=Deliveroo|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.deliveroo.co.uk/news/death-of-the-lunchbox.html|title=Death of the Lunchbox?|date=24 April 2017|publisher=Deliveroo|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> On 16 November 2016, it became known that the brewing company [[Heineken International]] had closed a deal for Deliveroo to deliver the latter's beers and ciders, initially across 15 sites in London, Bath and Cardiff. This delivery deal, whose activities started that same week, was considered the biggest one of its kind (that is, with regards to the brewing industry). Further expansion of these activities across the UK were planned by the end of the year 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/11/16/heineken-joins-deliveroo-to-create-booze-delivery-brand/|title=Heineken joins Deliveroo to create booze delivery brand|series=Business|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=16 November 2016|access-date=18 November 2016|first=Jillian|last=Ambrose}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.beveragedaily.com/Retail-Shopper-Insights/Deliveroo-Heineken-partner-on-beer-delivery-brand|title=Deliveroo and Heineken partner to launch beer delivery brand|newspaper=Beverage Daily|first=Rachel|last=Arthur|date=17 November 2016|access-date=18 November 2016}}</ref>

In January 2017, Deliveroo announced plans to create 300 tech jobs in the U.K. when it opened its new head office in London later in 2017. Also in January 2017, the British-born company employed more than 1,000 full-time staff.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38659329|title=Deliveroo to add 300 UK tech jobs in new London office|work=BBC News|date=18 January 2017|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref>

In April 2017, Deliveroo's Editions kitchens launched. These delivery-only kitchens, sometimes known as [[ghost restaurant]]s, allow restaurants to access customers in locations without needing [[High Street]] premises, thereby reducing set-up costs compared to a full-service restaurant. Deliveroo uses its data to identify areas where customer demand for certain cuisines is high and predicts which restaurants are likely to succeed there.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/04/05/deliveroo-opens-30-kitchens-meet-surging-takeaway-demand/|title=Deliveroo opens 30 kitchens to meet surging takeaway demand|first=James|last=Titcomb|date=5 April 2017|work=Daily Telegraph|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/1e516472-1a11-11e7-a266-12672483791a|title=Deliveroo expands with standalone takeaway kitchens|first=Madhumita|last=Murgia|date=5 April 2017|work=Financial Times|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref>

In mid-June 2016, the founders of Deliveroo, Will Shu and Greg Orlowski received an award for the "Best Startup Founders" as part of "The Europas Startup Conference and Awards", mainly given to [[Technology company|technology companies]]. The company also received Fastest Rising Startup of the Year and the Europas Grand Prix award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/17/the-europas-awards-2016-honored-the-best-tech-startups-in-europe/|title=The Europas Awards 2016 honored the best tech startups in Europe|first=Mike|last=Butcher|date=17 June 2016|publisher=TechCrunch|access-date=3 November 2016}}</ref>

Deliveroo recorded a loss of £1.4m for the year 2015. Mid-November 2016, the company reported a loss of £18.1 million for that year. In September 2017, Deliveroo recorded a growth in global revenue of 611% in 2016, with sales of £128.6 million, while "losses soared from £30.1m to £129.1m".<ref name="Deliveroo-boss-doubled-his-pau-ahead-of-riders">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/11/deliveroo-boss-pay-ahead-riders-protest|title=Deliveroo boss doubled his pay ahead of riders' protest |newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 November 2016|access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/09/21/deliveroo-revenues-grow-600pc-losses-stack/|title=Deliveroo revenues grow over 600pc but losses stack up |first=James|last=Titcomb|date=21 September 2017|work=Daily Telegraph |access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref>

Deliveroo provides the delivery service as well as [[marketing]] and order taking, allowing it to provide food from restaurants that do not normally offer a delivery service. In a press release of May 2016, the German Bar Association ({{lang-de|Der Deutsche Anwaltverein}}) informed the public that delivery companies such as Deliveroo, Take Eat Easy or Foodora are legally responsible for problems about the quality of the food, not the restaurants themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anwaltauskunft.de/magazin/leben/freizeit-alltag/1675/foodora-deliveroo-co-die-rechtslage-bei-den-neuen-lieferdiensten/|title=Foodora, Deliveroo & Co.: Die Rechtslage bei den neuen Lieferdiensten|series=Ernährung|publisher=Deutsche Anwaltauskunft (Das Rechtsportal des Deutschen Anwaltvereins)|date=6 May 2016|access-date=3 November 2016}}</ref>

As of 2020, Deliveroo has not yet made a profit. It loses money on every single delivery it makes.<ref name="theguardian-ball">{{cite news|first1=James|last1=Ball|access-date=2020-05-03|title=Deliveroo was the poster child for venture capitalism.

By mid 2020, Deliveroo hadn't benefited from the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], when demand for food delivery from restaurants and takeaways surged. Deliveroo reported to be cutting 367 jobs (and furloughing 50 more) from its workforce of 2,500.<ref name="Ball">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/02/deliveroo-venture-capitalism-food-delivery-business-model|title=Deliveroo was the poster child for venture capitalism.

===Economic impacts in the UK===
In December 2017, a study by macroeconomic consultancy Capital Economics revealed that Deliveroo had helped create 7,200 jobs across the restaurant sector since it launched in 2013. It also boosted the industry's revenue by £460 million in the year to June 2017. The report also found that Deliveroo had helped add £372 million in value to the UK economy in the same 12-month period, a figure which Capital Economics projects to rise to £1.5 billion in the year to June 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/12/19/nations-appetite-takeaway-could-make-deliveroo-worth-15bn-uk/|title=Nation's appetite for takeaway could make Deliveroo worth £1.5bn to UK economy by 2019|first=Bradley|last=Gerrard|date=19 December 2017|work=Daily Telegraph|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref>

===Competition===
Deliveroo's main competitors are [[Just Eat]], [[GrubHub]] and [[UberEATS]].<ref name=Telegraph />

Early June 2016, the German Hotel and Catering Association ({{lang-de|Deutscher Hotel- und Gaststättenverband}}) cautioned for delivery services such as Deliveroo or [[Foodora]] (a competitor using almost an identical business model; and at that time almost equally present in Germany), claiming that they attack their value chain without respect. In this warning, the Association wanted to prevent the market for food delivery services starting to resemble that of hotels, where businesses have become dependent on booking portals such as [[Booking.com]] or HRS but are unsatisfied with the commission fees charged by those portals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2016-06/foodora-lieferdienst-essen-geschaeftsmodell|title=Die pinkfarbene Verführung|newspaper=ZEIT ONLINE|date=7 June 2016|access-date=3 November 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, [[Just Eat]] announced that they were planning to compete with Deliveroo by moving into the restaurant chain market, working with local independent restaurants and chains.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c57d9798-72a4-11e7-93ff-99f383b09ff9|title=Just Eat looks to battle Deliveroo for restaurant chains|newspaper=FT TIMES|date=27 July 2017|access-date=1 March 2018}}</ref>

===Number of employees===
One media article reported that in early August 2016, Deliveroo had 800 employees,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-05/deliveroo-raises-275-million-to-escalate-food-delivery-wars |title=Deliveroo Raises $275 Million to Escalate Food-Delivery Wars |last=Satariano|first=Adam |website=Bloomberg.com|date=5 August 2016|access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref> while another article of around the same date reported there were 6,500 riders working with by the company.<ref name="Dubai">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/retail/food-delivery-service-deliveroo-aims-to-expand-in-dubai|title=Food delivery service Deliveroo aims to expand in Dubai|first=Sananda|last=Sahoo|date=7 August 2016|access-date=12 November 2016|newspaper=The National}}</ref> On 8 September 2016, ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that 20,000 self-employed couriers were working for Deliveroo.<ref name="When-your-boss-is-an-algorithm">{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/88fdc58e-754f-11e6-b60a-de4532d5ea35|title=When your boss is an algorithm|newspaper=Financial Times|first=Sarah|last=O'Connor|date=8 September 2016|access-date=13 November 2016}}</ref> In September 2017 Deliveroo confirmed that the company works with 30,000 riders across the globe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/09/21/deliveroo-revenues-grow-600pc-losses-stack/|title=Deliveroo revenues grow over 600pc but losses stack up|first=James|last=Titcomb|date=21 September 2017|work=Daily Telegraph|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref>

=== Technical malfunctions ===
On 7 September 2016, the Deliveroo website and application crashed in the city of [[Chelmsford]], reportedly due to a high demand on the first night of launching its service in that city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.essexlive.news/deliveroo-website-crashes-on-first-night-in-chelmsford/story-29692362-detail/story.html|title=Deliveroo website crashes on first night in Chelmsford|date=7 September 2016|access-date=13 November 2016|newspaper=EssexLive|first=Ric|last=Brown}}</ref>

On Tuesday 1 November 2016, at around 8 pm (GMT), technical problems caused the Deliveroo system to go offline for around an hour. Reportedly, thousands of customers who had already paid for their orders got upset due to a lack of clear communication being provided by the company during the incident, with some customers having to wait hours to get their food delivered.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/deliveroo-website-crashes-leaving-hungry-12114441|title=Deliveroo website crashes leaving hungry customers FUMING|date=1 November 2016|access-date=13 November 2016|newspaper=Birmingham Mail}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/london-is-starving-hungry-londoners-left-angry-and-waiting-hours-for-food-after-deliveroo-site-a3384756.html|title='London is starving': Hungry Londoners left angry and waiting hours for food after Deliveroo site crashes|first=Francesca|last=Gillett|date=1 November 2016|access-date=13 November 2016|newspaper=EveningStandard}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bailiwickexpress.com/jsy/life/current-affairs/hungry-people-nation-go-state-panic-deliveroo-website-goes-down/|title=Hungry people of the nation go into a state of panic as Deliveroo website goes down|newspaper=Bailiwick Express|date=1 November 2016|access-date=13 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/deliveroo-website-goes-down-leaving-9175888|title=Deliveroo website goes down leaving thousands of hungry customers waiting for their food|date=1 November 2016|first=Richard|last=Wheatstone|newspaper=Mirror Online}}</ref>

During periods when the system is down, and therefore no deliveries are available for riders, Deliveroo pays riders a flat rate per hour until the system is restored.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guide to riding for Deliveroo and Uber Eats in the UK|url=https://yourconsumerguide.co.uk/2017/10/07/working-for-deliveroo-ubereats-uk/|website=Your Consumer Guide|access-date=16 May 2019|date=7 October 2017}}</ref>

=== Taylor Review ===
In October 2016 Prime Minister Theresa May announced a review into employment practices in the modern economy,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/employment-practices-in-the-modern-economy|title=Employment Practices in the Modern Economy|date=1 October 2016|publisher=HM Government|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> chaired by Chief Executive of the RSA Matthew Taylor. The review was criticised, accusing the probe of being biased as it was revealed by the Financial Times that one of its members was an early backer of Deliveroo, a fact that was not disclosed to the public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taylor review member was early Deliveroo backer|date=10 July 2017|url= https://www.ft.com/content/95392a68-6596-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614|work=Financial Times}}</ref> In its submission<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.deliveroo.co.uk/news/taylor-review-submission.html|title=Deliveroo sets out plans to give greater protections to riders|date=7 July 2017|publisher=Deliveroo|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> to the review, Deliveroo called on the Government to update legislation to allow the company to offer its riders rights - such as injury pay and sick pay - without limiting the flexibility which comes with self-employment. The company was the first in the on-demand economy to break ranks and ask for changes in legislation to enable it to offer self-employed riders more benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/deliveroo-breaks-ranks-by-offering-riders-sick-pay-l7z5rkzw3|title=Deliveroo breaks ranks by offering riders sick pay|first=Sam|last=Coates|date=7 July 2017|publisher=Times|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> Deliveroo argued that current employment legislation means companies in the on-demand economy are forced to choose between offering riders flexible work and benefits. Deliveroo suggested that the Government either allow companies to offer entitlements to self-employed people or create a new category of employment in which benefits are calculated on the services they deliver instead of how many hours they work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/07/06/deliveroo-proposes-employment-laws-overhaul-let-give-riders/|title=Deliveroo proposes employment laws overhaul to let it give riders benefits|first=James|last=Titcomb|date=6 July 2017|work=Daily Telegraph|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref>

=== Rider safety ===
In response to the attacks on moped drivers over the summer of 2017, Deliveroo announced a series of measures to help keep riders safe. Among the measures introduced were a new app feature that allows riders to raise security concerns, plus a trial of helmet cameras to allow Deliveroo to gather evidence and to pass on information to the police. The company also hired 50 new staff across the country who have a focus on rider safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40805224|title=Deliveroo takes steps to protect workers from violence|first=Catrin|last=Nye|date=3 August 2017|publisher=BBC|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/03/deliveroo-riders-wear-helmet-cameras-spate-acid-attacks/|title=Deliveroo riders to wear helmet cameras after spate of acid attacks|first=Cara|last=McGoogan|date=3 August 2017|work=Daily Telegraph|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref>

=== Leaving the German market ===
On 12 August 2019, Deliveroo sent an email to German customers stating their decision to leave the German market and indicating that all services would stop from 16 August.<ref>{{cite news |title=Food delivery service Deliveroo pulls out of Germany |url=https://www.dw.com/en/food-delivery-service-deliveroo-pulls-out-of-germany/a-49996572 |access-date=13 August 2019 |agency=Deutsche Welle}}</ref> The email cited its inability to provide a sufficient quality of service and that it would focus on other markets. The announcement came days after acquiring Scottish startup Cultivate, and three months after raising £450 million in a funding round led by Amazon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-takes-bite-deliveroo-450-061951253.html|title=Amazon takes bite of Deliveroo in £450m funding round|website=uk.finance.yahoo.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>

== Praise ==
In a 2016 study of the sharing economy, PwC wrote that 'the UK has also contributed one of the sharing economy's quickest-growing stars' in Deliveroo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/megatrends/collisions/sharingeconomy/outlook-for-the-sharing-economy-in-the-uk-2016.html|title=The sharing economy grows up: How the UK has embraced the sharing economy|publisher=PwC|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref>

On awarding Deliveroo 'Best Startup Founders' in the Europas Awards 2016, ''TechCrunch'' declared that founders Will Shu and Greg Orlowski 'have proved a rock-star team, scaling a high-growth business and introducing new thinking to the market.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/17/the-europas-awards-2016-honored-the-best-tech-startups-in-europe/|title=The Europas Awards 2016 honored the best tech startups in Europe|first=Mike|last=Butcher|date=17 June 2016|publisher=TechCrunch|access-date=3 November 2016}}</ref>

In November 2016, ''Management Today'' argued that Deliveroo has become 'one of the best' in the food delivery sector 'thanks to its [[Unique selling proposition|USP]] of providing a network of dedicated couriers and an ordering platform, making it easy for restaurants which wouldn't otherwise offer delivery, to do so.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/real-innovation-awards-winners/future-business/article/1413951|title=Real Innovation Awards: The Winners|date=15 November 2016|publisher=Management Today|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref>

Deliveroo topped Deloitte's annual ranking of the UK's fastest growing technology companies in November 2017, with a four-year revenue growth of 107,117% - a record for the UK Technology Fast 50 awards. David Cobb, lead partner for the Deloitte UK Technology Fast 50 programme, commented: 'The achievements of this year's winner are truly remarkable: Deliveroo is now the fastest-growing technology company in the history of the competition. Their relentless growth has justifiably added them to the exclusive list of UK 'unicorns'. Everyone wants a slice of the online takeaway business, but very few have found success in the same way that Deliveroo has.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/press-releases/articles/records-break-as-deloitte-announces-the-2017-uk-technology-fast-50-winners.html|title=Records break as Deloitte announces the 2017 UK Technology Fast 50 winners|date=16 November 2017|publisher=Deloitte|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref>

== Criticisms ==
Australian-based employment lawyer [[Josh Bornstein]], principal at [[Maurice Blackburn (law firm)|Maurice Blackburn]], examined work contracts from Deliveroo and its competitor Foodora in late March 2016 and described the contracts as "sham", designed to pay workers "below the [[Industrial_award|award rates]]" and to "deny their basic benefits".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/deliveroo-and-foodora-accused-of-using-sham-contacts-for-bicycle-delivery-riders-20160329-gnsu7g.html|title=Deliveroo and foodora accused of using sham contracts for bicycle delivery riders |first=Patrick|last=Hatch|date=30 March 2016|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=3 November 2016}}</ref>

Maurice Blackburn announced that test cases against Deliveroo, as well as against Foodora, were being prepared wherein they were "accused of under-paying their delivery riders and failing to meet minimum employment conditions". Such allegations were confirmed by the Young Workers Centre in Australia, which claimed that the contracting arrangements by those companies left workers without access to [[minimum pay]] rates, [[Workers' compensation|WorkCover]] insurance, leave and [[superannuation]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/delivery-services-foodora-and-deliveroo-face-claims-of-exploitation-underpayment-20160728-gqfgwz.html|title=Delivery services Foodora and Deliveroo face claims of exploitation, underpayment|date=29 July 2016|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=3 November 2016}}</ref> The centre's "Rights for Riders" campaign aims "to improve safety, pay, conditions and job security for food delivery riders".<ref>Young Workers Centre, [http://www.youngworkers.org.au/rights4ridersfaq Rights for Riders FAQs], accessed 3 January 2017</ref>

Complaints have also been made regarding the company's failure to provide cycle training and safety equipment (such as lights and [[Bicycle helmet|helmets]]) to its sometimes inexperienced riders. It has been argued that the need to race against the clock is another reason for risky cycling behaviour exhibited by the couriers; and that bikes should be checked for safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/deliveroo-cyclists-cause-road-mayhem-riding-against-the-clock-0m3l3rv0d|title=Deliveroo cyclists are accused of causing mayhem 'riding against the clock'|last2=Boswell|first2=Josh|date=5 June 2016|access-date=13 November 2016|first1=Grace|last1=Marsh|newspaper=The Sunday Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://road.cc/content/news/170695-deliveroo-criticised-letting-inexperienced-riders-loose-without-lights|title=Deliveroo criticised for letting inexperienced riders loose without lights|last=Laker|first=Laura|date=8 November 2016|website=road.cc|access-date=13 November 2016}}</ref>

The term and its corresponding social media [[hashtag]] were adopted by several news outlets, including non-English international media.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=International Business Times|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/london-deliveroo-drivers-stage-protest-over-slaveroo-changes-pay-1575603|title=London Deliveroo drivers stage protest over 'slaveroo' changes in pay|date=11 August 2016|access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://novaramedia.com/2016/10/27/slaveroo-industrial-action-and-cooperativism-what-does-the-future-of-the-digital-platform-economy-hold/|title=#Slaveroo, Industrial Action and Cooperativism: What Does the Future of the Digital Platform Economy Hold?|first=Jim|last=Benfield|date=27 October 2016|access-date=12 November 2016|publisher=[[Novara Media]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/futurs/2016/08/12/a-londres-les-coursiers-de-deliveroo-deja-en-greve_1471994|newspaper=Libération|title=A Londres, les coursiers de Deliveroo déjà en grève|first=Perinne|last=Signoret|date=12 August 2016|access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vn.nl/waarom-het-succes-van-de-deliveroo-staking-een-beetje-hoop-geeft/|publisher=Vrij Nederland|title=Waarom het succes van de Deliveroo-staking een beetje hoop geeft|first=Clara|last=van de Wiel|date=17 August 2016|access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref>

In the aftermath of these protests, Mags Dewhurst, chair of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain Couriers and Logistics Branch, which represents couriers and delivery drivers in London, published an article in ''The Guardian'' backing the protesters, saying that Deliveroo's claims of offering freedom and flexibility, vis-à-vis its couriers, are a sham, calling them "bywords for exploitation and exhaustion".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/16/deliveroo-couriers-strike-freedom-william-shu|title=Deliveroo couriers are right to strike: the company's claims of freedom are a sham|first=Mags|last=Dewhurst|date=16 August 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref>

On 8 November 2016, news headlines covered the demand of a small group of UK Deliveroo drivers to seek union recognition by the company. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) represented the drivers in the [[Camden Town|Camden]] area of [[north London]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-deliveroo-idUKKBN1331A7|title=After Uber case, UK union pushes for pay deal at Deliveroo|series=Technology News|date=8 November 2016|access-date=13 November 2016|publisher=REUTERS|first=Costas|last=Pitas|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Addison}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/deliveroo-union-minimum-wage-uber-workers-rights-ruling-a7404326.html|title=Deliveroo drivers demand union recognition and minimum wage after Uber workers' rights ruling|first=Ben|last=Chapman|date=8 November 2016|access-date=13 November 2016|newspaper=The Independent}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/32308032-a599-11e6-8898-79a99e2a4de6|title=Deliveroo couriers demand union recognition and rights in UK|series=Gig Economy|first=Madhumita|last=Murgia|date=8 November 2016|newspaper=Financial Times|access-date=13 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37905425|title=Deliveroo riders seek to unionise and gain workers' rights|first=Clive|last=Coleman|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 November 2016|access-date=13 November 2016}}</ref> In November 2017, the Central Arbitration Committee dismissed the challenge by the IWGB and ruled that Deliveroo riders are self-employed.

===The Netherlands===
In 2017 and 2018 Dutch online consumer affairs journalist Tim Hofman investigated Deliveroo undercover, asserting that the company forced its delivery staff to declare themselves self-employed rather than being employees of the company, which would give them rights to benefits such as sick pay. The investigation and presentation of the evidence to Deliveroo management was released as episodes of the #BOOS online programme.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bogosavac |first1=Nina |title=Deliveroo nog meer onder druk na nieuwe undercover #Boos-aflevering |url=http://vance.nl/deliveroo-nog-meer-onder-druk-na-nieuwe-undercover-boos-aflevering/ |website=Vance |publisher=OKGO BV |access-date=5 December 2019 |language=NL |date=23 February 2018}}</ref>
